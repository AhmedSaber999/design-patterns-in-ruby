# Design Patterns in Ruby

## Design Patterns

* [Factory Pattern](factory.md): creates objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created

* [Singleton Pattern](singleton.md): restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.

* [Template Method Pattern](template-method.md): allows you to defines a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and let subclasses override the steps without changing the overall algorithmâ€™s structure.
